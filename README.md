Project folders architecture:
1) Assets - static and skeletal meshes, animations(including AnimBP), materials, textures(including UI).
2) Audio - all sounds and background music
3) Blueprints - all inherited from c++ classes objects, using for gameplay.

6) UI - all widgets
7) C++ classes - I think it's not necessary to explain
